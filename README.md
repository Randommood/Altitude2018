# The burden of a successful feature: Scaling our real time logging platform
Accompanying repository for the talk given at Fastly's London Altitude. Feel free to open any issues for questions and/or to say hi :)

## Abstract
Observability is a hot topic in the computing world: we’ve all dealt with systems that are difficult to reason about because we have no visibility into what they’re doing. Fastly’s real time logging gives you immediate visibility into your application’s behavior at the edge. It streams millions of request logs per second and can ship data to customer defined infrastructure including 3rd party cloud services. In this talk we’ll give you a peek into the logging platform, share some challenges we found along the way and the lessons we learned from them. And more importantly we’ll talk about what we are doing to evolve this platform into the future.
